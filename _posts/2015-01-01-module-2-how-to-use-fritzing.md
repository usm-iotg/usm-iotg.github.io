# Overview

Fritzing is a software for designers and makers to protyping their product or electronic projects. 

## Why Fritzing?

We believe fritzing is useful regarding the following advantages:

* enable rapid protyping of product or electronic projects.
* easy to use, easy to share (your prototype).
* ensure your PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layout is properly documented. 
* make your project repeatable using designed layout.
* useful for classroom and assemble guides.

## What it looks like?

Fritzing is just a simple application, equipped with many components (including sensors, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, transistors, boards, etc) inside which is ready for your protyping. Besides you can import other components library (for example, [Sparkfun Fritzing Parts](https://github.com/sparkfun/Fritzing_Parts)) in order to enrich your prototype layout. 

## Where to get?

You can go to the Fritzing download [page](http://fritzing.org/download/) and install inside your PC.

## What's next?

Intel Galileo component are not shipped with default official Fritzing. Here we give you a sample of Intel Galileo (Gen1) project with Fritzing so that you can start protyping your project from given sample.
